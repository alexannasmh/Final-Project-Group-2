# Final-Project-Group-2

Our project focuses on how gene expression differs in individuals with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) compared to healthy controls. To investigate this, we will use RNA-seq data from blood samples and apply tools such as HISAT2 for read alignment and DESeq2 for analyzing differential gene expression. Our approach centers on identifying genes that are significantly upregulated (overexpressed) or downregulated (underexpressed) in AD samples. We will then perform functional annotation and pathway analysis using EnrichR to interpret the biological significance of these changes. Through transcriptomic analysis, we aim to uncover key gene expression patterns associated with AD and gain insight into the molecular mechanisms driving disease progression.
